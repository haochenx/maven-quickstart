Maven QuickStart
================

This repo provides a project skeleton for my own Maven projects.
It sets a few properties that I always set for every Maven project,
and include a few dependencies that I use in the most projects. Every
body is free and invited to take and modify this skeleton, just remember
that the default groupId and package is under my own domain, so you **SHALL**
change it. Suggestions are also welcomed.
